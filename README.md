# What Are Microservices?

Microservices are an architectural approach to developing software applications as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Instead of building a monolithic application where all the functionality is tightly integrated into a single codebase, microservices break down the application into smaller, loosely coupled services.

# How do Microservices work?

Microservices break complex applications into smaller, independent services that work together, enhancing scalability, and maintenance. Below is how microservixes work:

- Applications are divided into self-contained services, each focused on a specific function, simplifying development and maintenance.
- Each microservice handles a particular business feature, like user authentication or product management, allowing for specialized development.
- Services interact via APIs, facilitating standardized information exchange and integration.
- Different technologies can be used for each service, enabling teams to select the best tools for their needs.
- Microservices can be updated independently, reducing risks during changes and enhancing system resilience.
